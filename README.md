This is my [portfolio](https://marodriguez-mar.github.io/rodriguez-gis-portfolio/) for my Spatial Data Science class!

# About me
Michael (he/him) is a soon to be graduate of Carnegie Mellon's Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management with concentrations in Urban and Regional Development as well as Data Analytics. Michael best describes himself as a data nerd with a passion for urbanism. He has studied affordable housing, sustainable communities, transportation, and economic development. With a passion for data-driven decision making and urbanism, Michael is committed to working towards solutions for cities that are dealing with the consequences of unaffordable housing, transit access, and community resilience.

Before graduate school, Michael received his Bachelor's in Information Technology at the University of La Verne where he focused on building a foundation of skills in computational statistical analysis. Michael discovered the interdisciplinary and high impact nature of data science/analytics after serving as a research fellow for Marquette Universityâ€™s Data Science Across Disciplines summer program. Michael also served as a teaching assistant as part of a Social Justice Mathematics summer program where he instructed first-gen students on analyzing California racial profiling data as well as a section on quantifying the impact of gerrymandering. Most recently, Michael spent the summer of 2023 interning as a policy and data analyst with the Department of Transportation's Volpe Center where he work on projects around transportation planning and energy/sustainability analysis.

# What I hope to learn
Spatial data science feels like a very broad area study. With that said there are some techniques and skills I wish to gain from this class. 1) The first set of skills I would like to aquire is how to analyze data to identify spatial-temporal trends. 2) second, with the onset of emerging AI tools it would be interesting to see how AI can be incorporated into the workflow of ArcGIS. 3) Additionally, how to design web apps to showcase spatial analysis.
